# Blizzard Notify Website


### Project Recap

This is a website made for a Discord server that I owned, called Blizzard Notify. The purpose
for this website was to serve as a landing page where users can gather more information about 
the server. The server is now shut down but this website still exists. This website is fully
responsive and can be viewed across multiple different devices.
