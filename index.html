          <h2>How can I benefit from this group?</h2>
          <p>Blizzard Notify excels in providing various types of information to help improve your chances at purchasing a certain item. There are hundreds of channels for our members to use that consist of blazing fast monitors, raffles, upcoming releases, and guides for both manual and botting users.

We value our members and we expect them to value our information.</p>

          <h2>What makes Blizzard Notify stand out from other cook groups?</h2>
          <p>Blizzard Notify isn't just a group on Discord, it's a family. You have the opportunity to get to know other members and create a bond. Since our beginning in 2020, there have been hundreds of users joining and we get to know them on an individual basis. Although reselling is our top priority, we have the chance to provide assistance outside of that; college, homework, life goals, and we help our members develop skills they need in both reselling and life. We provide countless opportunities for our members to make profit and they take that chance to grow.</p>

          <h2>Do I need any prior experience before joining?</h2>
          <p>Not at all. Everyone started somewhere. From level 1 to level 100, everyone is at a different place. Regardless of what level you are on, Blizzard Notify starts at the beginning for everyone. We cater to our members and make sure that the information is detailed yet simple to understand. We turn manual users into botting users because we expose our members to new challenges and new methods.</p>
